\section{Introduction}
Standards are cool, everybody should have some and stick to them!

\section{Usecases, Features, and Requirements}

In case of a collision on the bus, that is, two devices are sending data at the same time, we either receive:
\begin{itemize}
\item nothing,
\item garbage, or
\item correct data, in case two devices are sending identical data and we have good conditions for (un)lucky coincidences.
\end{itemize}
Therefore we cannot make any assumption on what will happen in this case.

\begin{itemize}
\item up to about 200 devices per bus segment
\item fast auto discovery and negotiation of devices
\item collision avoidance
\item no realtime guarantees yet, as-fast-as-possible communications
\item single busmaster, multiple busmaster capable candidates
\item busmaster handover to other busmaster capable devices

\end{itemize}



\section{Architectural Overview}
\subsection{Participants and their Roles in haqbus}
There ar two kinds of devices partaking in comunication: Those who are capable of becoming busmaster and those who aren't.
The first are called \emph{potential busmaster} or PBM, the latter \emph{not master capaple} or NMC.
As a matter of fact, there is no problem in designing all devices as PBMs, for practical reasons this might not be desired as it will
slow down busmaster negotiation and cost resources wich can be scarce on small devices. 
There must be at least one PBM on each bus segment.

There are currently 4 roles in which a device could participate in a \haqbus installation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item active busmaster (ABM)
\item standby, or sleeping, busmaster (SBM)
\item passive slave (PAS)
\item not attached (NOA) 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        device type & device role \\ \hline
        PBM         & ABM         \\ 
        PBM         & SBM         \\ 
        PBM         & NOA         \\
        NMC         & NOA     \\
        NMC         & PAS         \\
        	 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{%
    All valid combinations of device types and their roles.    
    }
\end{table}

Keep in mind, that a SBM is a PBM-device, that in most cases acts very much like an NMC-device in its role as PAS, with the one difference,
that it can become an ABM if required, e.g. if there is no other ABM on the bus.
A PBM- or NMC-device will change its role to NOA when powered on and further change its role to SBM, or PAS when it is recognized by the ABM.
In case there is no ABM present, a PBM in NOA-role will become the new ABM.
If you understood the last three sentences, you will have memorized by now the shorthands for devices and their roles.

\subsection{Basic Interaction between Participants}
Rule 1: The active busmaster is responsible for doin' all the stuff. (At least mostly all off the time.)

The thing we want to do is, to avoide all possible collisions by using time division multiple access
(TDMA) with dynamic timeslots that are coordinated by the ABM.

\begin{itemize}
\item If an ABM is present, it is the only device that is allowed to speak without permission.
\item The ABM tells other devices (SBM, PAS, and NOA) in regular intervalls when and for how long they are allowed to speak.
\item The ABM respect these time periods and doesn't interfere while a SBM, a PAS or a NOA is speaking.
\item SBM and PAS speak only when they are asked to and no longer than they are allowed.
\item NOA speak only, when asked by the ABM (discovery) or when they detect that there is no ABM present (master discovery).
\end{itemize}

Once, an ABM is established and in control, this should provide a reasonable stable and deterministic flow of data without any collision.
Whether this is still the case in situations where data packets get corrupted is still to examine!
However, this can only be applied after a discovery phase, which will be discussed in the next section.



\subsection{Layer Specification}
Bus communication is done in 4 different Layers ... or 3 or 5 or 23?? FIXME
They correspond to the famous ISO/OSI layer model as follows... NOT , so FIXME

%Traditional OSI ISO Stuff:
%Layer 1: physical layer	PLEASE
%Layer 2: data link layer	DO
%Layer 3: network layer		NOT
%Layer 4: transport layer	THROW
%Layer 5: session layer		SALAMI
%Layer 6: presentation layer	PIZZA
%Layer 7: application layer	AWAY
%Layer 8: user

\section{Layer one (nameme osi 1)}
TIA/EIA-485 \cite{EIA485}.

Main channel is used with symbolrate of 500000 baud. 



\subsection{Cable Definition}
The used cables are twisted pair cables of 4 pairs plus shielding, that are commonly used for  PentanewsGameshow-buzzers or e.g. in Ethernet cabeling.
The standard suggested is EIA/TIA-568A~\cite{EIA568}.
But rule No. 1 of RFC1925 \cite{RFC1925} applies

\section{Layer two (nameme osi 2+3)}

\subsection{Busmaster Discovery and Negotiation}
At cold start or when the current busmaster drops out (disconnected, failure), there will be no communication flow on the bus.
When this is detected, the busmaster role must be negotiated between all busmaster capable device.

TODO: Describe busmaster discovery and negotiation.


FIXME: Should there be an announcement of the protocol version in use?
This way an upgrade to more advanced future protocols (e.g. real time capable with timeslots) will be easier.


\subsection{Bus Checking Phase}
During the bus checking phase the busmaster checks which of all registered devices are still alive. For this the busmaster iterates over its internal table of registered devices and sends a paket of type ASKSTAT~\ref{cp:ASKSTAT} to them.

\subsection{Paket Types}
All Pakets of this layer are at least 4 Bytes long and prefixed with the packet delimiter Byte 0x00. 
Since 0x00 is the paket delimiter any 0 Byte in all other fields of a packet  must be escaped

\subsubsection{ASKSTAT}
Busmaster ask a slave for status

\end{bytefield}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{STALIVE}

%\begin{bytefield}{32}
%\bitbox{8}{len}&\bitbox{24}{data\ldots} \\
 %\bitbox{16 CRC16}\\
%\end{bytefield}
